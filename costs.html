                <h1>The Main Costs You Should Know Before Reading!</h1>
                <p>Below is a table of the main costs you should be aware of when applying for your learner's license and taking your driving tests. Keep an eye out for the cost on the bottom of the table, this is the cost that you will face if you are caught driving without a supervisor once you get your learner license. As well as this, once you have gotten your learner license, you will need to know the cost for getting your restricited license, which as seen on the table is quite costly, so make sure you are well prepeared. </p>
